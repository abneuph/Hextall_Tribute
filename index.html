    <p id="tribute-info"> Ron Hextall was one of the most well-known, and best, goaltenders in the history of the Philadelphia Flyers. He is most notable for his fiery temper, exceptional puck handling, as well as being the first NHL goaltender to score a goal. (A task he managed to accomplish twice.)</p>
